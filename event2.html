                <p class="announcement-content">
                    You have heard correct. VAIL has joined the VRML family! We are super excited to welcome all of you VAIL enthusiasts! To get started, we'll be hosting a 3-week Preseason followed by a full-fledged Season.
                </p>
                <p class="announcement-content">
                    Start date for Preseason is Monday, January 15th. That's when matches will be generated! Make sure your team is set to active around NOON EST. Otherwise, you'll have to wait until Week 2 to get matches. So don't waste any time!
                </p>

                    The Preseason is 3 weeks and Season 1 is  12 weeks of regular matches. Afterwards, there will be 3 weeks of post-season tournaments to determine the Champions. Every week during the regular season, teams will get assigned 1 opponent and schedule to play a match within that week. An extra challenge match may be played with a team within your skill-level.
                </p>
                <p class="announcement-content">
                    Because this is a new league, all teams will be at the same starting point. Preseason will help sort more experienced teams from newer teams prior to Season 1. Play as many matches as you can to get your rank!
                </p>
                <p class="announcement-content">
                    Teams will not have a visible MMR score on day 1. They will need to play 3 matches to be placed on the ladder and perhaps a 4th or 5th to determine the color of their star. Teams will be ranked by points until their MMR score is revealed. More information about the ranking system, the matchmaking algorithm, and the divisions can be found in the Rules and in Discord.
                </p>
                <p class="announcement-content">
                    "Roster Lock" is the 29th of April.  After this date, no roster changes may be made or the team will risk their qualification in the post-season tournaments. Post-season starts May 25th with the "Challenger Cup" or "Qualifiers". More information about these events and prize pool will be made available soon!
                    A team may sign up at anytime during the season before the Roster Lock. Some restrictions may apply regarding the qualification of teams for the post-season events.
